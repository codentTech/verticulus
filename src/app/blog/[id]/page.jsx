        <p>Building scalable React applications requires careful planning and adherence to best practices. As your application grows, maintaining code quality and performance becomes increasingly important.</p>
        
        <h2>1. Component Architecture</h2>
        <p>Design your components with reusability in mind. Break down complex components into smaller, focused pieces that can be easily tested and maintained. Use composition over inheritance and keep components pure when possible.</p>
        
        <h2>2. State Management</h2>
        <p>Choose the right state management solution for your application. For smaller apps, React's built-in state might be sufficient. For larger applications, consider Redux, Zustand, or Context API with useReducer.</p>
        
        <h2>3. Performance Optimization</h2>
        <p>Implement React.memo, useMemo, and useCallback to prevent unnecessary re-renders. Use React.lazy for code splitting and implement proper loading states for better user experience.</p>
        
        <h2>4. Code Organization</h2>
        <p>Organize your code into logical folders and files. Separate concerns by feature rather than by type. Use consistent naming conventions and maintain a clear folder structure.</p>
        
        <h2>5. Testing Strategy</h2>
        <p>Implement comprehensive testing using Jest and React Testing Library. Write unit tests for components, integration tests for features, and end-to-end tests for critical user flows.</p>
        
        <p>By following these best practices, you can build React applications that are maintainable, performant, and ready to scale with your business needs.</p>
